                    <p>Last week was weird because I got to go off the farm for two days. My a cappella
group, Novis, had a gig at the Alamo Drafthouse last Wednesday as a pre-show for
the movie Pitch Perfect, so I went up to UTD for a bit. We had a good time, and
the audience seemed to like us a lot! Plus, I used the faster network speeds to
get a few important downloads done.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/08-singsong/novis.jpg" /></p>
<p>It was nice getting away from the farm, because I've been really busy around
here. (You're probably all a bit tired of me saying that one.)</p>
<p>Monday night I installed all of the new switches, completely rerouting the
network. Of course, after the install, strange things have been happening, but
that can wait for when I've got my new gateway set up.</p>
<p>Speaking of gateways, it's not done yet. Last week's last-minute travel plans
messed with my time schedule, so I'm behind for most of my projects. The
maintenance computer (nicknamed Obi Wan), instead of being up last Tuesday, is
now coming online tonight. The gateway (Darth Vader) might be delayed as late as
Thursday. At this point, I'm almost a week behind, and I am not happy about that
at all.</p>
<p>The left one is Obi Wan, and the right one is Darth Vader (if you can see him).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/08-singsong/obiwan.jpg" title="The network is down! Help me, Obi Wan Kenobi! You're my last hope!" />
<img alt="" src="images/08-singsong/vader.jpg" title="Obi Wan and Darth Vader will be reenacting the end of Episode III sometime this week." /></p>
<p>On a lighter note, I'll end with a story about goats. One day, when everyone was
away on a video shoot, I came out of the office and heard a goat bleating. I
found one just standing in the yard, looking quite lost. As soon as I stepped
outside, it started following me. Eventually, I found the rest of the herd, and
the two of us walked through the gate to be with the rest of the goats. By the
time we got close, the rest of the herd started following me, slowly trotting
behind me the whole way back to the gate. As I was walking back to the gate, I
couldn't help but think that I didn't know where they were supposed to be. I
certainly am not their shepherd, but they blindly followed where I led.</p>
<p>When Jesus looked upon the crowd and had pity, who were like "sheep without a
shepherd," I imagine that's just what it looked like: a flock of people, knowing
that they had no direction in life, and following the first thing that they
could grab hold of. When you don't have a shepherd, it's easy to follow someone
else who doesn't have any direction. Even though the goats knew who their
shepherd was, they were willing to follow someone completely new.</p>

        My name is Eric Dilmore, and I followed God's calling this summer to help at Greater Good Global Support Services (G3S2) this summer. G3S2 provides ideas and resources to help humanitarian efforts across national borders. I will be managing several Linux clusters here so that the G3S2 staff doesn't have to take days out of their schedules to figure them out. I am excited to get to use my computer skills for a great purpose as well as learn some new things while I'm here!
