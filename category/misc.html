                        <h3><a href="/episode-x-a-new-hope.html">Episode X: A New Hope</a></h3>
                        <p><p>It's 6 o'clock in the morning as I stumble out of the office on Thursday/Friday
night. I had waged war with Darth Vader for the last three nights, but this
time, I had done it. Vader guards the network with the packet filter, an elegant
firewall for a more civilized age. And as I go to bed, I'm excited to tell Matt
that we can finally leave the gateway in place for testing.</p>
<p>Of course, when I plugged it in the next day to show him, no ones' computers
stayed connected.</p>
<p>That's been the story of last week. <em>But</em>, the gateway does work now, in almost
every way I wanted to. Matt was only here a short time last week, but I was
really excited that he noticed it's faster. And there's software to monitor
who's using lots of the internet. And not a moment too soon, because I'm leaving
this Friday.</p>
<p>Now all I've got left is documentation, which isn't particularly exciting, but
is possibly the most important part of the summer. When I leave, Matt is going
to have to be able to figure out how it all works. I need prayers that I can
finish strong in this final stretch before I go home.</p>
<hr />
<p>EDIT: Mom pointed out that there weren't any pictures when I posted on Sunday.
Jachin took this picture while I was reading outside. The pictures weren't
candid for long, but this is one of the few that were.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/10-victory/reading.jpg" title="Sneaky, Jachin. Very sneaky." /></p>
<p>Also, now would be a good time to mention that if you didn't know there is
rollover text for every image on the blog, you've been missing some of the
story. Just hold your mouse over an image for about the amount of time it takes
to read half this sentence. And now you know.</p></p>

                        <p><p>It's been a really busy week of late nights. There are only two more weeks left,
and on my list of things ot do is still quite long. My goals for the rest of the
summer are to set up the new gateway (still haven't finished with that), to
document everything, and to automate <em>more</em> of the things.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/09-winding-down/tired-eric.jpg" title="Staged just a bit. But only a little bit." /></p>
<p>My plans for testing the gateway out were foiled by a failed power supply. I've
now got a fully testable configuration written, but the machine won't even turn
on. Hopefully one will be coming in the mail this week so that, if and when
things go wrong, I've got the time to set it right before I have to leave.</p>
<p>Last week, we had some guests. The Parks are a missionary couple that are
staying in Richardson for the coming year. I met them several weeks ago at the
conference, but they stopped by the Wallace farm for a night. And since they
live in Richardson, only a few blocks from UTD, I know I'll get to see them
again, too!</p>
<p>Well, I'm tired, and there's more work to do. So, back to more configurations!</p></p>

                        <p><p>Last week was weird because I got to go off the farm for two days. My a cappella
group, Novis, had a gig at the Alamo Drafthouse last Wednesday as a pre-show for
the movie Pitch Perfect, so I went up to UTD for a bit. We had a good time, and
the audience seemed to like us a lot! Plus, I used the faster network speeds to
get a few important downloads done.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/08-singsong/novis.jpg" /></p>
<p>It was nice getting away from the farm, because I've been really busy around
here. (You're probably all a bit tired of me saying that one.)</p>
<p>Monday night I installed all of the new switches, completely rerouting the
network. Of course, after the install, strange things have been happening, but
that can wait for when I've got my new gateway set up.</p>
<p>Speaking of gateways, it's not done yet. Last week's last-minute travel plans
messed with my time schedule, so I'm behind for most of my projects. The
maintenance computer (nicknamed Obi Wan), instead of being up last Tuesday, is
now coming online tonight. The gateway (Darth Vader) might be delayed as late as
Thursday. At this point, I'm almost a week behind, and I am not happy about that
at all.</p>
<p>The left one is Obi Wan, and the right one is Darth Vader (if you can see him).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/08-singsong/obiwan.jpg" title="The network is down! Help me, Obi Wan Kenobi! You're my last hope!" />
<img alt="" src="images/08-singsong/vader.jpg" title="Obi Wan and Darth Vader will be reenacting the end of Episode III sometime this week." /></p>
<p>On a lighter note, I'll end with a story about goats. One day, when everyone was
away on a video shoot, I came out of the office and heard a goat bleating. I
found one just standing in the yard, looking quite lost. As soon as I stepped
outside, it started following me. Eventually, I found the rest of the herd, and
the two of us walked through the gate to be with the rest of the goats. By the
time we got close, the rest of the herd started following me, slowly trotting
behind me the whole way back to the gate. As I was walking back to the gate, I
couldn't help but think that I didn't know where they were supposed to be. I
certainly am not their shepherd, but they blindly followed where I led.</p>
<p>When Jesus looked upon the crowd and had pity, who were like "sheep without a
shepherd," I imagine that's just what it looked like: a flock of people, knowing
that they had no direction in life, and following the first thing that they
could grab hold of. When you don't have a shepherd, it's easy to follow someone
else who doesn't have any direction. Even though the goats knew who their
shepherd was, they were willing to follow someone completely new.</p>

                        <h3><a href="/long-nights-get-longer.html">Long Nights Get Longer</a></h3>
                        <p><p>This last week has been a long one for me because I've been up late it seems
almost every night for several days. Some nights it was for the phone
configuration. Some nights is was for (failed) BIOS upgrades. Last night I just
couldn't sleep. And tomorrow night I'll be up rewiring the main switching
center, which may take most of the night.</p>
<p>Something else I've been seeing a lot of is the Debian install screen. It took
me a while to figure out how to avoid redownloading all of the data for every
install. Until then, I've been doing a lot of waiting.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/07-visitors/debian-install.png" title="That three minutes you see there turned into an hour for the next part." /></p>
<p>But I did get lots of good work done. I made big steps in simplifying the phone
configuration to something easy enough for someone new to look at it and know
what's going on. My Debian installs are all good tests for an install of a
maintenance computer to centralize network configuration. The half of the new
switches are installed, and the others are going in tomorrow night. Phones are
online to at least every building.</p>
<p>We also had a few visitors at the farm last week. Steve Mix, one of the
permanent residents, hosted a basketball camp, and one of the Wallace family
friends stayed on the farm while their daughter went to the basketball camp. It
was nice having someone else on the farm, even if only for two days.</p>
<p>This week is looking pretty busy, too. The maintenance computer that I'm
testing now should (hopefully) be ready to be put into production tomorrow, and
tomorrow night is the big wiring night. Wednesday night I'll be upgrading our
Hackintosh, which does most of the video editing around here. And Friday I'll be
about ready to put in a new gateway with a from-scratch configuration. (You know
that box between you and the internet? Our gateway is one of those, but bigger.)
So, I'm both looking forward to this coming week and dreading the next wave of
late nights.</p>
<p>In addition to prayers for my own strength and perseverance through the week, my
dad also needs some serious prayers this week. He's been working on a project at
work for over a month that has just been exhausting him. It was supposed to be
done this week, but now it's looking like there's still a week or two more to
go. He can use all of the peace that God can give him.</p></p>

                        <h3><a href="/empty-nest.html">Empty Nest</a></h3>
                        <p><p>Last week everyone was gone. Matt's wife Miriam, Loren, and Deb were all gone
all week, and Jachin was gone until Wednesday. It felt like Matt and I were the
only people on the farm for a lot of the week. (Matt's parents were also here,
and so were the Mixes, but I don't have a whole lot of contact with them on a
regular basis.) And while that freed me up to get some good work done, you've
got fair warning that it's a lot of tech stuff this week.</p>
<p>One of the big events this week is that the replacement switches came in. I
played around with one of the switches until it worked, which turned out to be
surprisingly easy. It's now set up in the farmhouse. So, that went well. Just
waiting for the Bradleys to get back now so that I can install the other one.</p>
<p>What I'm <em>really</em> waiting for is when the rest of the switches come in later
this week. Matt and I finalized plans on how to tear down the current mess of a
network and erect a new one from the ashes. That should be happening this Friday
or Saturday night, if the parts come in.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/06-emptynest/switch.jpg" title="Much simpler than the old ones." /></p>
<p>Because the farm was comparatively empty, Matt and I got to talk tech this week.
We spent a lot of time talking aobut what needed to stay in the phone
configuration and what needed to go away. We also spent a lot of time putting
together a timetable for when different parts of my work need to be done.</p>
<p>Something else I'm excited about is that he's given me passwords for more
computers! I now have logins on our two file servers, our DNS servers, and
another server which, as of now, has an undetermined purpose. (Perhaps Jango,
but I can't tell.) As I'm preparing to update all of the systems on the farm,
it's good to know what we've currently got on hand.</p>
<p>Matt insisted that I learn something that will help me next semester outside of
the farm network, and I told him that I'm going to be on a robotics team this
coming semester. We talked to the local high school robotics sponsor, and he
lent me some robot parts for me to tinker with. It might not be much, but it's
a start!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/06-emptynest/robots.jpg" title="Parts is parts." /></p>
<p>Everyone on the farm gathered in the farmhouse for the Fourth of July, and
Matt's parents (Mark and Jan) made hot dogs and hamburgers. Even Steve (the
main farm worker here, who I see very little of) came over for dinner. Then,
because we couldn't shoot fireworks around the farm due to the drought, we
watched the DC fireworks on TV.</p>
<p>This coming week I'm looking forward to putting together scripts to set up a
maintenance computer and the gateway, and also a complete wiring refactoring.</p>
<p>And now, I'm going to get back to work.</p></p>

                        <h3><a href="/slowing-it-down.html">Slowing It Down</a></h3>
                        <p><p>This was a pretty slow week as far as work on the farm went. The Asterisk
configuration is about as pretty as possible for now, and we've now got a
temporary firewall specifically set up for that server. We're missing a few
switches, and they won't be in for another day or two. In anticipation, I wound
up spending a lot of time labelling cables. In the process, some of the unnamed
(or unmarked) machines got new names for clarity of labelling. The Asterisk
server is Anakin, our old dJango server is Jango Fett, our Juniper gateway is
Juno Eclipse...</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/05-preparations/hub.jpg" title="Looks pretty, right? Don't look at the next one." />
<img alt="" src="images/05-preparations/labels.jpg" title="It's a jungle in there. There's a reason we need labels." /></p>
<p>Something else that slowed everything down was lack of email communication. The
email forwarders that Matt relied on for years are now being blocked by Gmail,
and so none of my emails went through for a while until we could figure out the
problem. For now we've got a workaround, and we're still waiting on a response
from Google. We're praying that this gets fixed quickly, because communications
are a big part of Matt's (and my own) work.</p>
<p>The lack of immediate tech stuff has given me time to get off the farm for a
while. Yesterday, Jachin (the other intern here) and I took a hike out to "the
mountain," which isn't really a mountain but it's the closest thing to it on the
Wallace's property. We took the scenic route around, through an old truck
graveyard, past a couple ponds, over a few fences, and up the side of the hill.
It was a good hour-and-a-half trek, and it was uphill both ways. It's beautiful
to see what God's made from such a view.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/05-preparations/dest.jpg" title="There's the destination, from the beginning. The lone tree at the top of the mountain." /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/05-preparations/jachin.jpg" title="Jachin decided to film the whole thing for his portfolio. Eric Dilmore's Mountain Adventures will be releasing on video, for the first time ever..." /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/05-preparations/tree.jpg" title="That same tree as in picture one, just much closer." /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/05-preparations/truck.jpg" title="It's not high, but the view from up here is breathtaking. And... where'd the car come from?" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/05-preparations/bones.jpg" title="We saw this on the way down, and I thought it was cool. No idea what it could be. Jachin said it was a chupacabra. We'll go with that one." /></p>
<p>I had the great opportunity to get to know Matt better by losing to him in board
games. He and I taught Jachin how to play <em>The Settlers of Catan</em> (a trading /
resource-management game), and Matt taught both of us <em>Acquire</em> (a
stock-collecting / money-making game). Last night, Matt said that he had never
won an <em>Acquire</em> game with so much money at the end. Matt's got a pretty good
taste when it comes to board games.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/05-preparations/catan.jpg" title="But I won the game of *Acquire* tonight!" /></p>
<p>I got a joyful surprise from First Baptist Church at Irving this week, too! Go
Now was asking local churches to send packages to us missionaries, and I got
mine Friday afternoon. I'd like to give a special thank you to the congregation
of First Baptist at Irving for that gift.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/05-preparations/thanks.jpg" title="Cool stuff! Like cards, Starburst, and Purell!" /></p>
<p>Our churchgoing experiment began today with the historic St. Olaf Lutheran
Church in Cranfills Gap. I was surprised how similar the Lutheran order of
worship was to a Presbyterian service, with differences in the <em>how</em> at every
step. I'm glad for the opportunity I had to worship there today!</p>
<p>Today in the service, we read the passage about God's providence to Abraham of a
sacrifice in exchange for his son. After God had already asked him to leave his
homeland for a new, remote land, and God gave Abraham and Sarah a son after
years of barrenness, God told Abraham to sacrifice his son on a nearby mountain.
Each time God called, Abraham responded, "Here I am." At the last moment, God
told Abraham to stop, and he provided a ram already prepared to be sacrificed.</p>
<p>Last week, I got to meet a group of people who said "Here I am" when God asked
them to leave their homeland to go teach the nations about Jesus. Just over a
month ago, I got to meet hundreds of college students who said "Here I am" when
they were called to go out and give their summer for the Lord. But God isn't
done calling them, and he's not done calling me, just as he wasn't done calling
out to Abraham. With the network here secure for the time being, I feel like
this is a good week to focus prayer on all of the missionaries who are dotting
the globe, that they wouldn't stop listening for God's callings. God still has
work to be done. Join me in praying that we would all be able to say "Here I am"
over and over again.</p></p>

                        <p><p>I'd like to start by confirming for regular readers that the phone server update
went as well as I could have hoped. After watching my setup script fail
beautifully about ten times, I finally walked away with a working phone system
at around 4:00 last Sunday night, upgraded and configured for easy maintenance.
I've been making little tweaks to it all week and have fixed some of the odd
quirks that the system used to have, also.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/04-missionaries/anakin.jpg" title="His name is Anakin. I'm going to start a Star Wars naming convention for all of the servers around here. Anakin is the first server I've worked on, but there will be others." /></p>
<p>With that done, I'd like to transition to the main happenings of last week: a
meeting of the Ethne missionary group to discuss global plans. About twenty new
people were staying on the farm, which doubled the number of people usually
staying here. Every bed was filled with missionaries who had come back from
Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>My goal this week was to hear as many interesting stories as possible from this
interesting group. They all said that they followed God's voice wherever they
were supposed to go, and it led them to completely unexpected places and
peoples. One went to work with the Kurds (an ethnic group in the Middle East)
when she felt a draw only when hearing the name of the people group. Another
went to Southeast Asia after hearing the name of the city several times within
a week, right when he began to pray about it. It was a pretty great testiment to
the power of listening to God because of the great work they've done in the
years they've had overseas.</p>
<p>We worshipped together every morning, which was a great experience. We got to
spend one morning in the old rock church. It was built in the 1800s and was
rennovated to be as close to the original look as possible. It was a wonderful
space to share in such powerful worship.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/04-missionaries/church.jpg" title="Originally built by vikings... I mean, Norwegians." /></p>
<p>The last of the missionaries left yesterday morning. It's going to get back to
normal now, to an extent. Loren and his wife Deb are planning on taking Jachin
and I on a church tour to a bunch of different denominations as an educational
experience, which I'm really excited about. We'll be going to two churches each
week just to learn about them. We're all excited to start that.</p>
<p>I have a feeling a lot of this week is going to be cleaning up the not-so-tidy
configuration that I put together for the phone server and trying to figure out
the best way to restring phones across to the distant houses. I'm going to need
all the patience God can give me for that task!</p></p>

                        <p><p>This week began with thunderstorms. Fortunately, thunderstorms bring rain, and
we need it here. Unfortunately, thunderstorms bring lightning, and lightning
doesn't get along very well with technology, especially when you're hit with a
dead-on strike.</p>
<p>And so, I apologize in advance. My week was lots of tech and very little people.
If you want to skip to the interesting part, I went to the rodeo this weekend.
Just scroll down to the fox, and start there.</p>
<p>I woke up Monday morning (an hour earlier than my alarm) with Loren and Deb (a
missionary couple back from Scotland staying with us and learning about film
production) knocking at my door. The phones were out down in the more distant
reaches of the farm, so it would be great if I could look at that. Also, Loren's
computer appears to be dead, and it would be nice if I could look at that, too.</p>
<p>Loren's computer was fairly easy to fix: motherboard's blown, so just plug the
hard drive in a different motherboard. The phone problem turned out not only to
be a phone problem, though: all internet access was down out there. An entire
switch went down in the first home, and so we would need to purchase a new one
to get everything back how it used to be. And, as I quickly found out, the
wiring for those houses is not documented. <em>And</em> Matt (supervisor) was busy or
out of town all week.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/03-thunderstruck/parkhomes.jpg" title="So close, and yet so far." /></p>
<p>On the plus side, we did get internet back to the farthest residence. There's
currently a wireless connection between two of the houses because we can't seem
to identify the cable running between them, and we don't have phones lines out
there yet, but it's a good enough patch job for now. Nevertheless, it was not
the way I would have preferred to start the week.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/03-thunderstruck/switch.jpg" title="He's dead, Jim." /></p>
<p>I spent the rest of the week preparing for a phone server update. I've got it
almost completely automated by now. Tonight, I'm going to be staying up beside
my computer to watch it happen. I effectively just need to be there for disaster
relief. This is about what I'll be seeing scroll past my screen for several
hours, starting at 11:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/03-thunderstruck/cows.png" title="It's udderly simple. Just moove the files from my computer to the server. Why cows? Just be-cud." /></p>
<p>I found out that you can use other animals, too, and couldn't resist making
these commands.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/03-thunderstruck/foxsay.png" title="Thank you, Linux." /></p>
<p>Speaking of cows, I got to go to the All Around Ranch Rodeo this weekend, which
Matt was filming. If you've ever been to a rodeo before, it's not necessarily
what you're thinking. Ranch rodeo contenders (teams of five) are actual cowhands
on farms, and the ranch rodeo is designed to show off skills they use on a
regular basis. While there was still bucking bronc riding, there were also
events like sorting and branding. In sorting, the team had to pick three
specific cattle out of a herd of 16 without letting any other cattle across the
line. In branding, they had to take down a cattle, hold its legs, and then give
it a chalk brand. Perhaps the most ridiculous event was the wild cow milking,
where the team has to hold a wild cow still long enough to get at least one drop
of milk into a bottle.</p>
<p>What really stuck with me is the pride that the cowboys had for their culture.
The rodeo opened with a rousing speech about the true American qualities that
cowboys expressed in their everyday work, including individuality, freedom, and
work ethic. As corny as it may sound to people who aren't from Texas (and
possibly to some people who are), the cowboys really take their heritage
seriously and I was struck by the genuineness of the whole presentation. You
could also tell by the way their children acted how passionate the cowboys were
about their lifestyle. Most were dressed in flannel shirts, jeans, and cowboy
boots. Kids as young as five were taking turns lassoing PVC pipe horses, dragged
by their friends. There was a mini-bronc riding competition for children under
ten. Everything the cowboys did, they wanted to instill in the next generation,
and it's a very different look at education than the rigorous schooling that is
stressed for children elsewhere.</p>
<p>I'll add pictures when I can get them from Matt, because there was some cool
stuff there.</p>
<p>Today is Father's Day, and it's frustrating to be away for my second Father's
Day in a row. The family just moved down to our new house in town last week, and
I wasn't there for it. I've heard it went pretty well, all things considered,
but I know it's been stressful for the whole family. But Dad, until I get home,
here's a cheesy selfie with a crazy blown-up cliche Father's Day message! Love
you, and wish I could be there with you all in the new house!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/03-thunderstruck/father.jpg" title="Andrew: If you're reading this, we're going to stage a *real* Father's Day on August 10 when I get home. Be prepared! If you know Andrew, you might want to mention that there is text with the pictures..." /></p>
<p>In the coming week, the farm is going to host a missionary conference. I'm not
sure how much real work I'm going to get done, but I'll certainly meet some
interesting people with interesting stories. Next project: Set up a proper
firewall, with traffic shaping.</p></p>

                        <p><p>It's odd to think it's only been a week here. It really feels like I've been on
the farm for much longer, possibly because I've been so busy while I'm here.</p>
<p>My first assignment was to help a doctor in Northern Africa for a field worker
who had been sick with a parasite for three weeks. The country he was living in
relied mostly on pharmacists for their medical needs, and none of their remedies
helped. Fortunately, G3S2 had some contacts in that part of the world, and he
had a good recommendation for a doctor. Although I didn't do any "searching,"
per se, I did get much better at writing emails. I was the main communications
channel between here and there. I was really excited to hear that he made it to
the doctor and had a follow-up visit scheduled for a few days down the road!</p>
<p>This last week I've also had my fair share of weird hardware come through my
workspace. An old printer that refused to connect to the network (fixed with a
crossover cable, for those who still remember those), an analog-to-VoIP phone
adapter to reconfigure, and a Dell computer that couldn't find its toolbar all
showed up to be fixed. (Two of those three are.)</p>
<p>We went to the Horny Toad Bar &amp; Grill down the road on Wednesday night for the
weekly pool tournament. I played terrible, but enjoyed myself anyway. The
restaurant is known for its jalapeño buns, which are just spicy enough to be
delicious. It's also known as the only restaurant in the town of Cranfills Gap,
so it gets pretty good patronage from the surrounding area. After I lost, I
played rummy with Mrs. Wallace, who picked up the game quite quickly for never
having played before. (She beat me quite badly.) And Loren Bradley, another
worker here, got second place in the pool tournament! (Pictures of him and his
wife next week, perhaps?)</p>

<p>I've been really astounded by the beauty of the night sky here. When we went to
camp near Hunt, Texas, I thought the stars couldn't get any brighter. Well, I
think it's even darker here than it was there, so the stars shine even brighter.
Something you lose about the stars in brighter areas is their depth: it's not
just how many of them there are that impresses you, but how far back they go.
It's the phenomenon that happened when the 3DS came out with video games.
Something that used to be flat becomes infinitely layered. There are shooting
stars every ten minutes or so. It makes you really appreciate God's promise to
Abraham when you can see all of the stars that he could have numbered for future
members of his family. Here are some pictures of my favorite star-watching spot,
in the daytime when my imperfect iPad camera can capture it.</p>

<p>Today at First Baptist Church at Cranfills Gap, the new pastor and his wife got
a good "pounding." Apparently, it comes from wedding gifts, where everyone would
bring a pound of something for the new couple. Now they have poundings for other
events, including welcoming in newcomers. The church had a good time welcoming
in Pastor Dustin and his family, and I learned about a fun tradition.</p>
<p>This week I'm gearing up to configure a complete reboot of the G3S2 phone
server. We did two full backups over the last couple days (one of the data to my
laptop and an exact clone on an extra hard drive), and I'm testing new builds on
my computer in virtual machines before I start messing around with the actual
system. (A virtual machine is like running a separate computer system within
your own computer, usually used for testing purposes or for isolating certain
tasks as a separate server.) I'm finding out that a simple upgrade isn't going
to be as easy as I'd hoped. There may be a few extremely late nights before this
is over. (At least once, when I actually do the upgrade.) I've got about a week
to prepare for that day, though.</p>
<p>Until then, I'll be doing more studying, more testing, and more Rubber Duck
debugging. (It often works quite well.)

case.</a>)</p>

                        <p><p>I made it to the farm! It's even more in the middle of nowhere than I'd
previously expected. I'll be spending the summer with the Wallaces, who set up
G3S2 at their old family farm. Yesterday and today I moved in and started to get
to know the family!</p>
<p>Matt (the "executive" head of G3S2) showed me around the farm. It's a very
pretty place. Anyone who is familiar with Texas plains a few days after a
rainstorm should be pretty familiar: low, rolling hills, sparse trees, and green
only where it needs to be. It would be perfect cowboy country if you could get
rid of all the roads.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/01-arrival/outdoors1.jpg" title="The &quot;park homes&quot;." /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/01-arrival/outdoors2.jpg" title="Pretty, no?" /></p>
<p>And, as on any good farm, there are dogs (3), cats (at least 3), horses (2),
and goats (countably infinite)!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/01-arrival/dogs.jpg" title="Dogs don't like standing still." /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/01-arrival/cat.jpg" title="Neither do cats." /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/01-arrival/goats.jpg" title="You can count them, and there are a lot. Therefore, their number is equal to aleph naught." /></p>
<p>Of course, I didn't come to spend time outside with the animals. I came to work
on computers, so that Matt doesn't have to. This is where I'll be spending more
of my time.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/01-arrival/computer1.jpg" title="So many parts!" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/01-arrival/computer2.jpg" title="More blinky lights than your bedroom can handle!" /></p>
<p>I also got to meet one of the G3S2 workers who went overseas. She flew to the
Middle East yesterday, and we met her for lunch by the airport before she left.
Minorities fleeing Syria are often targetted for human trafficking and other
persecution. Over the next week, this worker will be working to secure land for
a religious minority refugee camp. While you pray for my influence at G3S2 this
week, also keep her in your prayers!</p>
<p>I'll finish this first post by commemorating being completely unpacked with a
selfie in my new room!</p>

        My name is Eric Dilmore, and I followed God's calling this summer to help at Greater Good Global Support Services (G3S2) this summer. G3S2 provides ideas and resources to help humanitarian efforts across national borders. I will be managing several Linux clusters here so that the G3S2 staff doesn't have to take days out of their schedules to figure them out. I am excited to get to use my computer skills for a great purpose as well as learn some new things while I'm here!
