                    <p>I'd like to start by confirming for regular readers that the phone server update
went as well as I could have hoped. After watching my setup script fail
beautifully about ten times, I finally walked away with a working phone system
at around 4:00 last Sunday night, upgraded and configured for easy maintenance.
I've been making little tweaks to it all week and have fixed some of the odd
quirks that the system used to have, also.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/04-missionaries/anakin.jpg" title="His name is Anakin. I'm going to start a Star Wars naming convention for all of the servers around here. Anakin is the first server I've worked on, but there will be others." /></p>
<p>With that done, I'd like to transition to the main happenings of last week: a
meeting of the Ethne missionary group to discuss global plans. About twenty new
people were staying on the farm, which doubled the number of people usually
staying here. Every bed was filled with missionaries who had come back from
Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>My goal this week was to hear as many interesting stories as possible from this
interesting group. They all said that they followed God's voice wherever they
were supposed to go, and it led them to completely unexpected places and
peoples. One went to work with the Kurds (an ethnic group in the Middle East)
when she felt a draw only when hearing the name of the people group. Another
went to Southeast Asia after hearing the name of the city several times within
a week, right when he began to pray about it. It was a pretty great testiment to
the power of listening to God because of the great work they've done in the
years they've had overseas.</p>
<p>We worshipped together every morning, which was a great experience. We got to
spend one morning in the old rock church. It was built in the 1800s and was
rennovated to be as close to the original look as possible. It was a wonderful
space to share in such powerful worship.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/04-missionaries/church.jpg" title="Originally built by vikings... I mean, Norwegians." /></p>
<p>The last of the missionaries left yesterday morning. It's going to get back to
normal now, to an extent. Loren and his wife Deb are planning on taking Jachin
and I on a church tour to a bunch of different denominations as an educational
experience, which I'm really excited about. We'll be going to two churches each
week just to learn about them. We're all excited to start that.</p>
<p>I have a feeling a lot of this week is going to be cleaning up the not-so-tidy
configuration that I put together for the phone server and trying to figure out
the best way to restring phones across to the distant houses. I'm going to need
all the patience God can give me for that task!</p>

        My name is Eric Dilmore, and I followed God's calling this summer to help at Greater Good Global Support Services (G3S2) this summer. G3S2 provides ideas and resources to help humanitarian efforts across national borders. I will be managing several Linux clusters here so that the G3S2 staff doesn't have to take days out of their schedules to figure them out. I am excited to get to use my computer skills for a great purpose as well as learn some new things while I'm here!
