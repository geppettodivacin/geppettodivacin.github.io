                    <p>It's odd to think it's only been a week here. It really feels like I've been on
the farm for much longer, possibly because I've been so busy while I'm here.</p>
<p>My first assignment was to help a doctor in Northern Africa for a field worker
who had been sick with a parasite for three weeks. The country he was living in
relied mostly on pharmacists for their medical needs, and none of their remedies
helped. Fortunately, G3S2 had some contacts in that part of the world, and he
had a good recommendation for a doctor. Although I didn't do any "searching,"
per se, I did get much better at writing emails. I was the main communications
channel between here and there. I was really excited to hear that he made it to
the doctor and had a follow-up visit scheduled for a few days down the road!</p>
<p>This last week I've also had my fair share of weird hardware come through my
workspace. An old printer that refused to connect to the network (fixed with a
crossover cable, for those who still remember those), an analog-to-VoIP phone
adapter to reconfigure, and a Dell computer that couldn't find its toolbar all
showed up to be fixed. (Two of those three are.)</p>
<p>We went to the Horny Toad Bar &amp; Grill down the road on Wednesday night for the
weekly pool tournament. I played terrible, but enjoyed myself anyway. The
restaurant is known for its jalape√±o buns, which are just spicy enough to be
delicious. It's also known as the only restaurant in the town of Cranfills Gap,
so it gets pretty good patronage from the surrounding area. After I lost, I
played rummy with Mrs. Wallace, who picked up the game quite quickly for never
having played before. (She beat me quite badly.) And Loren Bradley, another
worker here, got second place in the pool tournament! (Pictures of him and his
wife next week, perhaps?)</p>

<p>I've been really astounded by the beauty of the night sky here. When we went to
camp near Hunt, Texas, I thought the stars couldn't get any brighter. Well, I
think it's even darker here than it was there, so the stars shine even brighter.
Something you lose about the stars in brighter areas is their depth: it's not
just how many of them there are that impresses you, but how far back they go.
It's the phenomenon that happened when the 3DS came out with video games.
Something that used to be flat becomes infinitely layered. There are shooting
stars every ten minutes or so. It makes you really appreciate God's promise to
Abraham when you can see all of the stars that he could have numbered for future
members of his family. Here are some pictures of my favorite star-watching spot,
in the daytime when my imperfect iPad camera can capture it.</p>

<p>Today at First Baptist Church at Cranfills Gap, the new pastor and his wife got
a good "pounding." Apparently, it comes from wedding gifts, where everyone would
bring a pound of something for the new couple. Now they have poundings for other
events, including welcoming in newcomers. The church had a good time welcoming
in Pastor Dustin and his family, and I learned about a fun tradition.</p>
<p>This week I'm gearing up to configure a complete reboot of the G3S2 phone
server. We did two full backups over the last couple days (one of the data to my
laptop and an exact clone on an extra hard drive), and I'm testing new builds on
my computer in virtual machines before I start messing around with the actual
system. (A virtual machine is like running a separate computer system within
your own computer, usually used for testing purposes or for isolating certain
tasks as a separate server.) I'm finding out that a simple upgrade isn't going
to be as easy as I'd hoped. There may be a few extremely late nights before this
is over. (At least once, when I actually do the upgrade.) I've got about a week
to prepare for that day, though.</p>
<p>Until then, I'll be doing more studying, more testing, and more Rubber Duck
debugging. (It often works quite well.)

        My name is Eric Dilmore, and I followed God's calling this summer to help at Greater Good Global Support Services (G3S2) this summer. G3S2 provides ideas and resources to help humanitarian efforts across national borders. I will be managing several Linux clusters here so that the G3S2 staff doesn't have to take days out of their schedules to figure them out. I am excited to get to use my computer skills for a great purpose as well as learn some new things while I'm here!
