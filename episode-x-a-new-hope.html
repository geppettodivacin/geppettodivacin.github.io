                    <p>It's 6 o'clock in the morning as I stumble out of the office on Thursday/Friday
night. I had waged war with Darth Vader for the last three nights, but this
time, I had done it. Vader guards the network with the packet filter, an elegant
firewall for a more civilized age. And as I go to bed, I'm excited to tell Matt
that we can finally leave the gateway in place for testing.</p>
<p>Of course, when I plugged it in the next day to show him, no ones' computers
stayed connected.</p>
<p>That's been the story of last week. <em>But</em>, the gateway does work now, in almost
every way I wanted to. Matt was only here a short time last week, but I was
really excited that he noticed it's faster. And there's software to monitor
who's using lots of the internet. And not a moment too soon, because I'm leaving
this Friday.</p>
<p>Now all I've got left is documentation, which isn't particularly exciting, but
is possibly the most important part of the summer. When I leave, Matt is going
to have to be able to figure out how it all works. I need prayers that I can
finish strong in this final stretch before I go home.</p>

        My name is Eric Dilmore, and I followed God's calling this summer to help at Greater Good Global Support Services (G3S2) this summer. G3S2 provides ideas and resources to help humanitarian efforts across national borders. I will be managing several Linux clusters here so that the G3S2 staff doesn't have to take days out of their schedules to figure them out. I am excited to get to use my computer skills for a great purpose as well as learn some new things while I'm here!
