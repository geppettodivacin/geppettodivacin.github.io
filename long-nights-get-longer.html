                    <p>This last week has been a long one for me because I've been up late it seems
almost every night for several days. Some nights it was for the phone
configuration. Some nights is was for (failed) BIOS upgrades. Last night I just
couldn't sleep. And tomorrow night I'll be up rewiring the main switching
center, which may take most of the night.</p>
<p>Something else I've been seeing a lot of is the Debian install screen. It took
me a while to figure out how to avoid redownloading all of the data for every
install. Until then, I've been doing a lot of waiting.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/07-visitors/debian-install.png" title="That three minutes you see there turned into an hour for the next part." /></p>
<p>But I did get lots of good work done. I made big steps in simplifying the phone
configuration to something easy enough for someone new to look at it and know
what's going on. My Debian installs are all good tests for an install of a
maintenance computer to centralize network configuration. The half of the new
switches are installed, and the others are going in tomorrow night. Phones are
online to at least every building.</p>
<p>We also had a few visitors at the farm last week. Steve Mix, one of the
permanent residents, hosted a basketball camp, and one of the Wallace family
friends stayed on the farm while their daughter went to the basketball camp. It
was nice having someone else on the farm, even if only for two days.</p>
<p>This week is looking pretty busy, too. The maintenance computer that I'm
testing now should (hopefully) be ready to be put into production tomorrow, and
tomorrow night is the big wiring night. Wednesday night I'll be upgrading our
Hackintosh, which does most of the video editing around here. And Friday I'll be
about ready to put in a new gateway with a from-scratch configuration. (You know
that box between you and the internet? Our gateway is one of those, but bigger.)
So, I'm both looking forward to this coming week and dreading the next wave of
late nights.</p>
<p>In addition to prayers for my own strength and perseverance through the week, my
dad also needs some serious prayers this week. He's been working on a project at
work for over a month that has just been exhausting him. It was supposed to be
done this week, but now it's looking like there's still a week or two more to
go. He can use all of the peace that God can give him.</p>

        My name is Eric Dilmore, and I followed God's calling this summer to help at Greater Good Global Support Services (G3S2) this summer. G3S2 provides ideas and resources to help humanitarian efforts across national borders. I will be managing several Linux clusters here so that the G3S2 staff doesn't have to take days out of their schedules to figure them out. I am excited to get to use my computer skills for a great purpose as well as learn some new things while I'm here!
