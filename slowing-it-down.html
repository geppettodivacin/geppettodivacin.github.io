                    <p>This was a pretty slow week as far as work on the farm went. The Asterisk
configuration is about as pretty as possible for now, and we've now got a
temporary firewall specifically set up for that server. We're missing a few
switches, and they won't be in for another day or two. In anticipation, I wound
up spending a lot of time labelling cables. In the process, some of the unnamed
(or unmarked) machines got new names for clarity of labelling. The Asterisk
server is Anakin, our old dJango server is Jango Fett, our Juniper gateway is
Juno Eclipse...</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/05-preparations/hub.jpg" title="Looks pretty, right? Don't look at the next one." />
<img alt="" src="images/05-preparations/labels.jpg" title="It's a jungle in there. There's a reason we need labels." /></p>
<p>Something else that slowed everything down was lack of email communication. The
email forwarders that Matt relied on for years are now being blocked by Gmail,
and so none of my emails went through for a while until we could figure out the
problem. For now we've got a workaround, and we're still waiting on a response
from Google. We're praying that this gets fixed quickly, because communications
are a big part of Matt's (and my own) work.</p>
<p>The lack of immediate tech stuff has given me time to get off the farm for a
while. Yesterday, Jachin (the other intern here) and I took a hike out to "the
mountain," which isn't really a mountain but it's the closest thing to it on the
Wallace's property. We took the scenic route around, through an old truck
graveyard, past a couple ponds, over a few fences, and up the side of the hill.
It was a good hour-and-a-half trek, and it was uphill both ways. It's beautiful
to see what God's made from such a view.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/05-preparations/dest.jpg" title="There's the destination, from the beginning. The lone tree at the top of the mountain." /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/05-preparations/jachin.jpg" title="Jachin decided to film the whole thing for his portfolio. Eric Dilmore's Mountain Adventures will be releasing on video, for the first time ever..." /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/05-preparations/tree.jpg" title="That same tree as in picture one, just much closer." /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/05-preparations/truck.jpg" title="It's not high, but the view from up here is breathtaking. And... where'd the car come from?" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/05-preparations/bones.jpg" title="We saw this on the way down, and I thought it was cool. No idea what it could be. Jachin said it was a chupacabra. We'll go with that one." /></p>
<p>I had the great opportunity to get to know Matt better by losing to him in board
games. He and I taught Jachin how to play <em>The Settlers of Catan</em> (a trading /
resource-management game), and Matt taught both of us <em>Acquire</em> (a
stock-collecting / money-making game). Last night, Matt said that he had never
won an <em>Acquire</em> game with so much money at the end. Matt's got a pretty good
taste when it comes to board games.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/05-preparations/catan.jpg" title="But I won the game of *Acquire* tonight!" /></p>
<p>I got a joyful surprise from First Baptist Church at Irving this week, too! Go
Now was asking local churches to send packages to us missionaries, and I got
mine Friday afternoon. I'd like to give a special thank you to the congregation
of First Baptist at Irving for that gift.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/05-preparations/thanks.jpg" title="Cool stuff! Like cards, Starburst, and Purell!" /></p>
<p>Our churchgoing experiment began today with the historic St. Olaf Lutheran
Church in Cranfills Gap. I was surprised how similar the Lutheran order of
worship was to a Presbyterian service, with differences in the <em>how</em> at every
step. I'm glad for the opportunity I had to worship there today!</p>
<p>Today in the service, we read the passage about God's providence to Abraham of a
sacrifice in exchange for his son. After God had already asked him to leave his
homeland for a new, remote land, and God gave Abraham and Sarah a son after
years of barrenness, God told Abraham to sacrifice his son on a nearby mountain.
Each time God called, Abraham responded, "Here I am." At the last moment, God
told Abraham to stop, and he provided a ram already prepared to be sacrificed.</p>
<p>Last week, I got to meet a group of people who said "Here I am" when God asked
them to leave their homeland to go teach the nations about Jesus. Just over a
month ago, I got to meet hundreds of college students who said "Here I am" when
they were called to go out and give their summer for the Lord. But God isn't
done calling them, and he's not done calling me, just as he wasn't done calling
out to Abraham. With the network here secure for the time being, I feel like
this is a good week to focus prayer on all of the missionaries who are dotting
the globe, that they wouldn't stop listening for God's callings. God still has
work to be done. Join me in praying that we would all be able to say "Here I am"
over and over again.</p>

        My name is Eric Dilmore, and I followed God's calling this summer to help at Greater Good Global Support Services (G3S2) this summer. G3S2 provides ideas and resources to help humanitarian efforts across national borders. I will be managing several Linux clusters here so that the G3S2 staff doesn't have to take days out of their schedules to figure them out. I am excited to get to use my computer skills for a great purpose as well as learn some new things while I'm here!
