                    <p>This week began with thunderstorms. Fortunately, thunderstorms bring rain, and
we need it here. Unfortunately, thunderstorms bring lightning, and lightning
doesn't get along very well with technology, especially when you're hit with a
dead-on strike.</p>
<p>And so, I apologize in advance. My week was lots of tech and very little people.
If you want to skip to the interesting part, I went to the rodeo this weekend.
Just scroll down to the fox, and start there.</p>
<p>I woke up Monday morning (an hour earlier than my alarm) with Loren and Deb (a
missionary couple back from Scotland staying with us and learning about film
production) knocking at my door. The phones were out down in the more distant
reaches of the farm, so it would be great if I could look at that. Also, Loren's
computer appears to be dead, and it would be nice if I could look at that, too.</p>
<p>Loren's computer was fairly easy to fix: motherboard's blown, so just plug the
hard drive in a different motherboard. The phone problem turned out not only to
be a phone problem, though: all internet access was down out there. An entire
switch went down in the first home, and so we would need to purchase a new one
to get everything back how it used to be. And, as I quickly found out, the
wiring for those houses is not documented. <em>And</em> Matt (supervisor) was busy or
out of town all week.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/03-thunderstruck/parkhomes.jpg" title="So close, and yet so far." /></p>
<p>On the plus side, we did get internet back to the farthest residence. There's
currently a wireless connection between two of the houses because we can't seem
to identify the cable running between them, and we don't have phones lines out
there yet, but it's a good enough patch job for now. Nevertheless, it was not
the way I would have preferred to start the week.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/03-thunderstruck/switch.jpg" title="He's dead, Jim." /></p>
<p>I spent the rest of the week preparing for a phone server update. I've got it
almost completely automated by now. Tonight, I'm going to be staying up beside
my computer to watch it happen. I effectively just need to be there for disaster
relief. This is about what I'll be seeing scroll past my screen for several
hours, starting at 11:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/03-thunderstruck/cows.png" title="It's udderly simple. Just moove the files from my computer to the server. Why cows? Just be-cud." /></p>
<p>I found out that you can use other animals, too, and couldn't resist making
these commands.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/03-thunderstruck/foxsay.png" title="Thank you, Linux." /></p>
<p>Speaking of cows, I got to go to the All Around Ranch Rodeo this weekend, which
Matt was filming. If you've ever been to a rodeo before, it's not necessarily
what you're thinking. Ranch rodeo contenders (teams of five) are actual cowhands
on farms, and the ranch rodeo is designed to show off skills they use on a
regular basis. While there was still bucking bronc riding, there were also
events like sorting and branding. In sorting, the team had to pick three
specific cattle out of a herd of 16 without letting any other cattle across the
line. In branding, they had to take down a cattle, hold its legs, and then give
it a chalk brand. Perhaps the most ridiculous event was the wild cow milking,
where the team has to hold a wild cow still long enough to get at least one drop
of milk into a bottle.</p>
<p>What really stuck with me is the pride that the cowboys had for their culture.
The rodeo opened with a rousing speech about the true American qualities that
cowboys expressed in their everyday work, including individuality, freedom, and
work ethic. As corny as it may sound to people who aren't from Texas (and
possibly to some people who are), the cowboys really take their heritage
seriously and I was struck by the genuineness of the whole presentation. You
could also tell by the way their children acted how passionate the cowboys were
about their lifestyle. Most were dressed in flannel shirts, jeans, and cowboy
boots. Kids as young as five were taking turns lassoing PVC pipe horses, dragged
by their friends. There was a mini-bronc riding competition for children under
ten. Everything the cowboys did, they wanted to instill in the next generation,
and it's a very different look at education than the rigorous schooling that is
stressed for children elsewhere.</p>
<p>I'll add pictures when I can get them from Matt, because there was some cool
stuff there.</p>
<p>Today is Father's Day, and it's frustrating to be away for my second Father's
Day in a row. The family just moved down to our new house in town last week, and
I wasn't there for it. I've heard it went pretty well, all things considered,
but I know it's been stressful for the whole family. But Dad, until I get home,
here's a cheesy selfie with a crazy blown-up cliche Father's Day message! Love
you, and wish I could be there with you all in the new house!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/03-thunderstruck/father.jpg" title="Andrew: If you're reading this, we're going to stage a *real* Father's Day on August 10 when I get home. Be prepared! If you know Andrew, you might want to mention that there is text with the pictures..." /></p>
<p>In the coming week, the farm is going to host a missionary conference. I'm not
sure how much real work I'm going to get done, but I'll certainly meet some
interesting people with interesting stories. Next project: Set up a proper
firewall, with traffic shaping.</p>

        My name is Eric Dilmore, and I followed God's calling this summer to help at Greater Good Global Support Services (G3S2) this summer. G3S2 provides ideas and resources to help humanitarian efforts across national borders. I will be managing several Linux clusters here so that the G3S2 staff doesn't have to take days out of their schedules to figure them out. I am excited to get to use my computer skills for a great purpose as well as learn some new things while I'm here!
