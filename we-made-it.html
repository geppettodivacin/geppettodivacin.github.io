                    <p>It's Tuesday and I still haven't posted my last blog. I'm just a bit behind,
because I'm home! Turns out, when there's not a lot to do, you find as many
non-productive things to do as you possibly can.</p>
<p>My last week at the farm was certainly not wasted, however. Matt and I talked
about the last things I should do to touch up the network. We put a few new
phones online, I showed Matt how to work the management computer, and I put a
new graphical interface on the gateway.</p>
<p>Jake and Morgan Wallace, Matt's college-age kids, were in for the last week.
Jake had guests on Thursday, and my family also stayed at the farm on Thursday
night, so we had a full house Thursday night. The Bradleys were kind enough to
make dinner for the entire farm. Loren made Apache fried-bread tacos and
cinnamon rolls. They were absolutely delicious. Matt gave us mementos to
remember the summer with (a coffee mug, mousepad, and a certificate), and he
also gave Jachin and I a chance to talk about our experience at the farm. It
was a great night to celebreate the time I had with the new friends I'd made.</p>
<p>My family decided to have a mini family vacation to the Blue Bell ice cream
factory on our way home. The tour was a lot of fun, and we got free samples of
ice cream. We got a sneak peak at the new flavor (which we have sworn not to
reveal the identity of). The most fun part was just spending time with by
brother. It's been a while since we've been together, and it'll be a while
again.</p>

<p>We drove Andrew back to school Saturday. He's got band camp this week. I'm
preparing to go back to school myself on Saturday. It certainly isn't long and
I'll be back in Dallas!</p>
<p>Just to wrap it all up, it's been a great summer. I got a crash course in
networking, and the people at G3S2 got a complete network overhaul. I also got
to have some really intense spiritual conversations with the Bradleys and
Jachin.</p>
<p>Thank you all for supporting me in prayer and with money. Without all of you,
this couldn't have happened!</p>
<p>I thought this picture of Jachin and I at the top of the mountain fit the end of
the summer quite well.</p>

        My name is Eric Dilmore, and I followed God's calling this summer to help at Greater Good Global Support Services (G3S2) this summer. G3S2 provides ideas and resources to help humanitarian efforts across national borders. I will be managing several Linux clusters here so that the G3S2 staff doesn't have to take days out of their schedules to figure them out. I am excited to get to use my computer skills for a great purpose as well as learn some new things while I'm here!
