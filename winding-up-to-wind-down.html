                    <p>It's been a really busy week of late nights. There are only two more weeks left,
and on my list of things ot do is still quite long. My goals for the rest of the
summer are to set up the new gateway (still haven't finished with that), to
document everything, and to automate <em>more</em> of the things.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/09-winding-down/tired-eric.jpg" title="Staged just a bit. But only a little bit." /></p>
<p>My plans for testing the gateway out were foiled by a failed power supply. I've
now got a fully testable configuration written, but the machine won't even turn
on. Hopefully one will be coming in the mail this week so that, if and when
things go wrong, I've got the time to set it right before I have to leave.</p>
<p>Last week, we had some guests. The Parks are a missionary couple that are
staying in Richardson for the coming year. I met them several weeks ago at the
conference, but they stopped by the Wallace farm for a night. And since they
live in Richardson, only a few blocks from UTD, I know I'll get to see them
again, too!</p>
<p>Well, I'm tired, and there's more work to do. So, back to more configurations!</p>

        My name is Eric Dilmore, and I followed God's calling this summer to help at Greater Good Global Support Services (G3S2) this summer. G3S2 provides ideas and resources to help humanitarian efforts across national borders. I will be managing several Linux clusters here so that the G3S2 staff doesn't have to take days out of their schedules to figure them out. I am excited to get to use my computer skills for a great purpose as well as learn some new things while I'm here!
